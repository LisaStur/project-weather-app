# Weather App

Technigo Remote Bootcamp project to learn and practice fetching info with API requests.

## The problem

Started with fetching the info from OpenWeather, spending quite some time trying to access various parts of the information. When I had the basics covered, I played around with various pieces of information (max- min temp and dropdown city-selector). Got a bit messy so reverted back to basic five day forecast with icons and geolocation.
If I had more time, I'd make a fallback/response for when the geolocater is not working or the user is not allowing access to her or his whereabouts.
